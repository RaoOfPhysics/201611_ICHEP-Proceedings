# Acknowledgements

This work would not have been possible without the supervision of Drs. Emma Weitkamp, Clare Wilkinson, Erik Stengler (all UWE Bristol) and Christine Sutton (CERN), who have guided me throughout my PhD studies. I would also like to thank the CMS Collaboration and in particular Achille Petrilli for providing the financial support for my research project. Finally, I would still be unsuccessfully wrangling with R code to produce my analysis and plots without Rik Smith-Unnaâ€™s kind help whenever I have needed it.
