# Conclusions

It is important to contextualise the results obtained from this survey by noting that 89% of the respondents had previously participated in some outreach activity.
The data also need to be carefully interpreted due to the limitations of Likert scales (the 1–5 ratings).
That said, among these respondents, the data show that the researchers see participation in outreach as a duty towards society and in particular tax payers, but show less support for the notion that outreach plans should be included in grant applications.
The respondents also indicated that while they get a sense of enjoyment from doing outreach, they don’t see it benefiting their careers directly.

The themes that have emerged in the quantitative data will be explored in the coming months by conducting personal, one-on-one interviews with selected members of CMS in order to perform an analysis using qualitative methods.
