## Engagement with fundamental research

Research into “public engagement” lacks literature concerning fundamental research.
Fields of research that get included in public-engagement studies often have either a direct or an immediate impact on human life and society.
Take for example a recent project on public attitudes to science conducted by Ipsos MORI in the UK, which addressed fields such as climate change, vaccination, renewable energy, medical ethics, nuclear research etc. but did not include areas of fundamental physics [4].

This paper is part of a project that is studying public engagement in the context of particle physics.
