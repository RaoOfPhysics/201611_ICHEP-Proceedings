## The population sample for particle physics

It is estimated that approximately half of all particle physicists in the world conduct their research using facilities provided at and by CERN, the European laboratory of particle physics [5].
Therefore, and although particle physics concerns more than merely research at colliders, the population of particle-physics researchers working at CERN can be thought to represent the whole field to a large extent.
However, care should be taken in making such an assessment given that the majority of researchers at CERN work for large collaborations with collaborators numbering in the thousands and large groups have different working conditions and outreach possibilities than smaller groups.
Nevertheless, the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Collaboration, which operates one of the two general-purpose particle detectors at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), was chosen as the sample of the CERN-based population.
CMS provides a wealth of cross-national and cross-cultural data on attitudes towards outreach, with more than 4000 scientists and engineers representing nearly 200 institutions from over 40 countries making up the collaboration (as of June 2015).
