## Defining outreach

In science-communication literature, the term “public engagement” is preferred when discussing communication between science and society.
However, particle physics favours the term “outreach”, as is evident from the creation of CERN’s “Education, Communication and Outreach” team following a restructure at the laboratory earlier this year and the existence of organisations such as the International Particle Physics Outreach Group (IPPOG).
Crettaz von Roten (2011) further lends support for the use of this term, noting that it is often used to refer to all science-communication activities “designed for an audience outside academia”.
