**\label{fig:fig1} Outreach and research funding** These plots show how respondents rated their agreement with three statements concerning outreach and research funding. From left to right, the plots show ratings for the following statements: (1) “It is important for scientists to take part in outreach activities because taxes from citizens fund research.” (2) “Funding bodies should provide support for scientists to communicate their research to the non-specialist public.” (3) “When applying for grants, scientists should be required to provide details on how their research will be communicated to the wider society.”
