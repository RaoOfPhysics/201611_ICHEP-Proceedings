## Role of funding bodies

Respondents were asked to rate their views towards the following statements on a scale of 1 (“Strongly Disagree”) to 5 (“Strongly Agree”):

- “It is important for scientists to take part in outreach activities because taxes from citizens fund research.”
- “Funding bodies should provide support for scientists to communicate their research to the non-specialist public.”
- “When applying for grants, scientists should be required to provide details on how their research will be communicated to the wider society.”

Respondents showed overwhelming agreement with the first two of these statements, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig1}.
However, they were less enthusiastic about the inclusion of outreach details in grant applications (also shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig1}).
