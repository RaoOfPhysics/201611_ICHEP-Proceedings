## Benefits of outreach participation

The respondents were also asked about the personal benefits of participating in outreach activities.
Specifically, and again on a scale of 1 (“Strongly Disagree”) to 5 (“Strongly Agree”), they were asked to rate their agreement with the following statements:

- “It makes me a better scientist.”
- “I get a feeling of enjoyment.”
- “It gives me job satisfaction.”
- “It attracts research funding.”
- “It advances my career.”
- “It is an opportunity for others to contact me for collaborative purposes.”
- “It shapes the direction of my research or makes me think about it in new ways.”

There was outright agreement with the idea that participating in outreach made one a better scientist, and also gave one enjoyment and job satisfaction (as shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig2}).
However, there was less agreement with the remaining statements (Figure \ref{fig:fig3}).

Some of this is probably to be expected.
For example, the expectation that two-way engagement shapes the direction of one’s research by involving more stakeholders in society is based upon experience from areas of research (such as biomedical science or robotics) that have a more immediate impact on human life.
It remains to be explored whether this expectation is a valid one when it comes to fundamental research such as particle physics.
