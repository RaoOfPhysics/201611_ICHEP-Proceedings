## Data

The survey was open for responses for a few months, with reminders sent regularly to all CMS members.
At the end of this period, 402 responses were recorded.
However, ten of the responses were duplicates, while one response was invalid for other reasons.
A total of 391 responses -- a little less than 10% of the CMS Collaboration -- was used for the final analysis.
It should be noted that 348 of the 391 respondents stated that they had previously participated in some outreach activity; this clearly highlights the self-selection bias of such data-collection methods.
