## Methods

To acquire data for performing quantative analysis, a web-based survey was circulated to all members of the CMS Collaboration.
The survey itself was prepared based on questionnaires that were used in previous studies on outreach ([INSERT CITATIONS]).

The electronic survey was hosted at CERN using the SharePoint infrastructure provided at the laboratory.
Access to the survey was restricted to CMS personnel and each respondentâ€™s name was recorded along with their answers.
Although the survey was confidential, auxiliary data about the respondents (age, nationality, institutional affiliation etc.) was extracted from the database of CMS members.
Details about this as well as the pilot survey and ethical considerations can be found in a previous paper on this project ([ADD CITATION]).
